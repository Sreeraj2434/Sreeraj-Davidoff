<h1>Best Indian Movies According To Sreeraj</h1>
<h2> My Top 3 Movies All Times. </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>VIKRAM</h3>
<p>Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too.</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>For me, it works. And, best of all, this movie is deeply sincere. It never undercuts moments of emotion and heart with cynicism. Despite its unflinching commitment to showcasing the violent brutality of the British colonists, RRR also feels like a deeply hopeful story.</p>
<h3>KGF</h3>
<p>So even though it has similar sentiments like being a people's champion, mother sentiment, respecting women etc. 'KGF' progresses in its own way. The film was an out and out Rocky (Yash) show and other characters, both positive and negative were just commentators enhancing his macho image</p>
